TUIO_CPP version 1.4 from https://github.com/TACC/DisplayCluster/blob/master/dependencies/TUIO_CPP-1.4.zip.

Mods:
* Ubuntu build compliance
* CMake/common submodule compatibility
* Correct oscpack library name and headers install location

Deprecation notice:
For new projects based on Qt >= 5.5, consider using Qt's TuioTouch plugin instead.

This library was used by Tide up to its 1.4 release (included).
It is kept as-is to allow building previous Tide releases, but it will no longer receive updates from the BlueBrain team.
